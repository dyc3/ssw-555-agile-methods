== Introduction
Open-source software (OSS) constitutes a pivotal component of contemporary computing, prompting considerable scholarly interest in the methodologies governing its development and maintenance. This paper aims to expound upon the ramifications of agile methodologies on open-source software development. The discourse commences with an exploration of agile methods, followed by an examination of the conventional open-source development process. Subsequently, an analysis comparing the management styles inherent in agile and open-source development is presented. Additionally, the paper scrutinizes selected open-source projects that incorporate agile methods. Ultimately, a comprehensive assessment is undertaken to elucidate the profound impact of agile methodologies on the realm of open-source development.

We sourced literature from various academic databases searching for key words ("Agile Methods", "Agile", "Open Source", "Software Project Management"), and found projects using agile methods through GitHub. We then analyzed the projects to determine how agile methods were used, and how they impacted the project.

== What is Agile?
Agile Methodologies, while there are a multitude of strategies to follow, primarly have a shared goal of increasing the rate of development for development teams. @Coram_2005 Software projects have many frequent changes throughout the life cycle as a result of changing user requirements. Developers needed a way to better handle these changes, which resulted in the creation of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The Manifesto emphasizes the value of the individual and interactions over tools and processes, and collaboration with the stakeholders over a negotiation. Functional software is also desired over solid documentation, as well as responsiveness and adaption to a situation rather than following a plan. @Eckstein_2004 To put it simply, the quality and efficiency of development is the goal of agile methods. Methods like Extreme Programming, SCRUM, Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM), and Test-Driven Development are popular in today's technology sector, all techniques designed for rapid development to deliver a product. One of the largest and longest-running surveys, State of Agile (2018), reports that 97% of organizations that responded to the survey use agile methods in their development practices. @Hoda_2018 The pulse of software development is to use agile methods for adaptive, reactive, and effective teams. 

=== Extreme Programming
The objective of Extreme Programming (XP) is to get the project done in a straightforward manner. Compared to the highly decorative process of the waterfall model, XP relies on communication, feedback and simplicity. XP is comprised of 5 phases: Exploration, Planning, Iterations to Release, Productionizing, Maintanence and Death. @Beck_2000 Exploration is the time period where requirements are defined with the customer. Teams prioritize requirements during the planning phase, and then developed in iterations to the first release. Further development and testing is completed during Productionizing to ensure that the release meets customer requirements. Finally, new iterations are executed to correct, perfect and adapt the code with changes for the customer, and the Death phase produces all documentation until the system is no longer needed. @Coram_2005 XP works best for small, localized teams so the use of XP would not be benefical due to the nature of open source development. @Turnu_2006

=== Test-Driven Development
Test-Driven Development (TDD) requires tests to be written before the code itself is written. The design of the software changes through the tests as the rapid cycle of adding new tests, passing those tests and cleaning the code by refactoring is executed ("test-code-refactor"). @Turnu_2006 It is imperative that the tests are automated to ensure that there is no technical debt from manually running tests. If they are automated, minimal effort is required to be run over and over again. The debugging process in TDD is simplified because bugs can be found earlier with the tests, making it easier and quicker to develop a full project. @Turnu_2006

=== SCRUM 
The next agile method commonly used in agile development is Scrum. Scrum is an agile framework that is a series of steps designed to manage and control the process of software and product development. There are specific roles defined in Scrum to delegate work and leadership, as well as to make sure the team evolves with the changing requirements. There is a Product owner, Scrum master, Scrum team, all working cross functionally with developers and testers. @Srivastava_2017 All requirements for the project are documented in the product backlog. Work is divided into Sprints, which is a block of time (usually 1-3 weeks) where developers work on defined requirements from the product backlog. @Coram_2005 The goal of each sprint is to deliver a potentially shippable product. At the end of each sprint, there is a sprint review to demonstrate the increment (work completed) and reflect on the way work was completed. @Srivastava_2017

=== Dynamic System Development Method

The Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM) is different from other methods in that resources and time are prioritized, and functionally is adjusted around those parameters. Phases of DSDM are still iterative (similar to Scrum and XP) with pre-defined periods of time. DSDM begins with assessing the project and building a development plan, followed by outlining a prototyping plan and system architecture. During the functional model iteration phase, the requirements, functions and risk analysis are created for the project. Finally, the project is designed and built to meet the minimum set of requirements through iterative sessions, and then finally the software is delivered to the customer. @Coram_2005
== Typical Open Source Development

Open-source software development entails a collaborative endeavor involving both developers and users. Users possess the capability to actively contribute to the software's advancement by identifying and reporting bugs, proposing features, and even submitting code. Developers, in turn, leverage this feedback to enhance the software. Notably, open-source software development diverges from conventional software development in two pivotal aspects. Firstly, users have the opportunity to participate directly in the software's development, including but not limited to contributing code. Secondly, the majority of developer collaboration occurs asynchronously through online platforms.

Over the course of time, the genesis of open-source software has undergone notable evolution. @Fitzgerald_2006 The initiation of an open-source project diverges markedly from that of a conventional software undertaking. In the latter, the project lifecycle encompasses four overarching phases: planning, analysis, design, and implementation. Conversely, certain open-source projects commence with a solitary developer or a small group who identify a personally compelling problem to address. @Bonaccorsi_Rossi_2003 The planning phase is often condensed, and requirements analysis is frequently nominal or absent. @Fitzgerald_2006 Notably, contemporary open-source projects have experienced increased financial backing, leading to a proliferation of startups embracing open-source development practices.

A distinctive characteristic of open-source software development is the frequent anonymity of contributors. This anonymity arises from the absence of a requirement for contributors to disclose personal information during the contribution process. This stands in stark contrast to traditional software development, wherein developers typically operate in close proximity, facilitating face-to-face communication and engendering a disparate project management dynamic.

=== Project Management in Open Source Software

In numerous smaller open-source projects, a singular figure, often referred to as the "Benevolent Dictator For Life," assumes the roles of project manager and lead developer simultaneously. @Schneider_2022 @Reagle_2007 This individual delineates the project's objectives and priorities and retains sole authority in making conclusive decisions regarding feature additions. The person in question assumes complete ownership of the code and bears absolute responsibility for its oversight. While this approach offers a straightforward method of project management, its scalability diminishes with project growth. In mid-sized open-source projects, a small cadre of individuals may collectively manage the project, adhering to the foundational principles of the "Benevolent Dictator For Life."

It is noteworthy, however, that not all open-source projects adhere to this management paradigm. Certain open-source initiatives are overseen by corporate entities, wherein the company assumes responsibility for project development, and developers are entrusted with the task of actualizing the project. While reminiscent of traditional software development models, developers in this context still retain the capacity to contribute to the project. Importantly, developers in such management structures typically wield an equitable influence in determining the code integrated into the project.

Despite these alternative management models, numerous expansive and widely utilized open-source projects persist under the ultimate guidance of a Benevolent Dictator. A prime illustration of this is the Linux kernel, where Linus Torvalds assumes the role of the Benevolent Dictator For Life. However, beneath his purview exists a hierarchical structure comprising maintainers tasked with overseeing distinct facets of the kernel. These maintainers assume the responsibility of scrutinizing and endorsing the quality of submitted code as it ascends the chain of command, ultimately reaching Linus Torvalds. @user229044_2010 @How-Linux-is-Built

== Comparing Agile and Open Source Management Styles
Agile and Open Source management styles are quite similar in a few different aspects. Regarding the process of developing software, while agile methods have predefined processes and sequences, numerous open source projects also have structured processes. Agile is built on individual capability and the motivation of those individuals, each person equally invested and contributing to the project. Open source differs from this in that there are a large number individuals participating in development, but a few Chief Programmers who contribute the majority of the source code. @Eckstein_2004

The way agile and open source teams function are quite similar. Self-organization is a shared trait among agile and open source teams. In Agile, self-organized teams are important to adapt and adjust to changing requirements. In open source, there is a common focus so all contributing individuals join and follow the goals, organizing in a way that results in maxium productivity. Close collaboration is required within the team (in methods of pair programming, review, etc), whereas open source teams are scattered in different parts of the world, working asyncronously. This makes the nature of collaborative development different but effective for the tasks at hand. @Eckstein_2004

Agile projects typically involve frequent customer/stakeholder interactions, with feedback being gathered throughout the development process. This allows for early identification and correction of any issues, and helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the customer. Open source projects, on the other hand, typically have a less formal approach to customer interactions. This is due to the fact that open source projects are often volunteer-driven, and it can be difficult to coordinate stakeholder meetings with a global community of contributors. @hunt_adapting_2010

Additionally, Agile projects are designed to deliver working software in short increments, which allows for early feedback from customers and stakeholders. This feedback can then be used to improve the product before it is fully released. Open source projects also release software frequently, but the feedback loop is typically less direct. This is because open source projects often have a large community of users, and it can be difficult to track down and gather feedback from everyone. @hunt_adapting_2010

Despite these differences, Agile and Open Source management styles share some important similarities. Both approaches value flexibility, adaptability, and iteration. They also both emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication. As a result, these two management styles can be complementary, and they can be used together to achieve great success.

== The Impact of Agile Methods on Open Source Development
As Agile Methodologies integrate into mainstream development due to the positive effects on code quality and quick response time, aspects of agile are emerging into open source development. A trend in open source projects appear to be the adoption of Testing and Continuous Integration. The implementation of automated tests establishes trust among the developers involved with the open source project because passing tests demonstrates that their code works, and that the code does not have to be rewritten by other developers. @Turnu_2006 Integrating testing into open source projects will also require shorter development cycles to assure quality of code throughout the development process. @Coram_2005

Agile Methods also require strong developers who communicate well. @Coram_2005 The nature of an open source project might change to adapt more forms of communication between developers to adapt to changing requirements of the project. The level of skill that a developer has might also be checked before an individual is allowed to contribute to source code. Developers that require "hand-holding" could struggle in an agile environment, negatively impacting the rate of development. @Cohn_2003

Interactions with customers during open source development using agile methods will have to be more frequent and with more influence. Agile Methods require the customer to partake in a role on the development team throughout the entire development process to ensure the end product meets the user requirements. Communicating through documentation will also be less important using Agile Methods since the priority is development over documentation (especially in DSDM), but still necessary in open source development. Compared to the easy coversation in a traditional development team, the asynchronous development of open source requires some kind of documentation to catch new members up to speed. @Coram_2005

=== Case Study: Visual Studio Code

The Visual Studio Code project, commonly referred to as VSCode, stands as a open source integrated development environment (IDE) crafted by Microsoft. @Visual_Studio_Code In alignment with agile methodologies, the project adopts a transparent approach by publicly disclosing its roadmap and monthly iteration plans on GitHub. This transparent sharing of insights and plans enables not only an open view of forthcoming developments but also encourages community engagement and feedback. The iterative nature of VSCode's development, facilitated by these public iterations, allows for rapid adjustments, enhancements, and the integration of user suggestions or reported issues within short time frames. This agile method empowers continuous improvement and iterative development, fostering a more responsive and user-oriented evolution of the software.

The substantial proportion of VSCode users being developers not only delineates a unique demographic but significantly bolsters the agile attributes of the project. This amalgamation of users as potential contributors streamlines the feedback collection process, expediting its integration into the project. The inherent capability of community members to directly contribute to the project materializes as an efficient mechanism for rapidly incorporating user feedback, ultimately fortifying the project's agile nature.

== Case Study: Keptn

Keptn, an open-source Kubernetes observability tool initially conceived by Johannes Bräuer and presently overseen by Dynatrace, strategically employs agile methodologies in its project management. To harmonize the open-source framework with agile practices, Keptn segregates its developer cohort into distinct groups: the "core" team, comprising Dynatrace employees, and a "contributor team." The core team rigorously engages in biweekly sprints, orchestrating their progress from a comprehensive product backlog accessible through their GitHub repository. Given the transient nature of contributor involvement, contributors operate independently from the sprints, leveraging a Kanban board that grants them flexibility in their task selection. @Bräuer_2021 

This structural dichotomy is deliberately crafted to enhance organizational efficiency in release planning. The sprints meticulously define the assured components of each release, while contributions from the contributor team serve as supplementary enhancements, augmenting the final release composition. @Bräuer_2021

== Conclusion

Agile methodologies, characterized by their emphasis on flexibility, adaptability, and collaboration, have forged a symbiotic relationship with open-source software development, a paradigm driven by community participation and shared ownership. This convergence has ushered in a new era of software development, one that prioritizes responsiveness to user needs, continuous improvement, and an unwavering commitment to quality.

Open-source software projects, by their very nature, demand a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. As a distributed community of developers, contributors from around the globe come together to build and maintain software, often under unpredictable circumstances. Agile methodologies, with their emphasis on incremental development and iterative releases, provide a well-suited framework for managing this dynamic environment.

The collaborative nature of open-source software development aligns perfectly with the core values of agile methodologies. Frequent interactions between developers, testers, and users foster a sense of shared ownership and responsibility, ensuring that the software evolves in the right direction. Agile practices, such as pair programming and code reviews, promote knowledge sharing and collective problem-solving, further strengthening the collaborative spirit of open-source projects.

Agile methodologies have also had a positive impact on the quality of open-source software. The emphasis on testing and continuous integration, hallmarks of agile development, has led to a more rigorous approach to software quality assurance. This has resulted in a significant improvement in the overall quality and stability of open-source software, making it more attractive to a wider range of users.

The interactions between agile methodologies and open-source software development is a testament to the power of collaboration and adaptability in the modern software development landscape. By embracing these principles, open-source projects have not only produced high-quality software but have also fostered a community of passionate developers who are constantly pushing the boundaries of innovation.

As the software development landscape continues to evolve, understanding and navigating the interactions between agile methods and open-source development will become increasingly crucial for fostering innovation, responsiveness, and sustained growth in the ever-dynamic world of technology.
